To do
--------------
Put together simple end-to-end tests


Reserves
    quickstart, spinning reserve margins
    satisfy various reserve margins
Policies
    POLICY_REGIONS 
        ..geographical_region ? (could mean either state or province, but is less familiar and more vague. SubnationalDivision could work, but may not be as flexible for international interconnections. Jurisdiction and PolicyRegion are also options.)
    lz_policy_region[z] default None
    carbon caps
    # implement tech build restrictions with proposed project restrictions..
RPS Policy

CCS

Generators
    default heat rate (possibly put in thermal_generation.tab)
    construction schedule
    unit commitment & partial loading params (should go in separate module)
Specialty dispatch
    CAES, Pumped Hydro, Flexible baseload
Projects
    integration with gen heat rate
    replacing earlier projects (partially implemented)
    location competition
    hourly fixed costs
Units...
    Incorporate Matthias's unit-level specifications

Low priority
------------------
Enable more upstream emission types for fuels, including CH4
Allow generators to burn multiple fuels, possibly at different heat rates
    cofiring biomass with coal
    oil generators that can run on multiple fuel types
    different flavors of coal have different extra pollutants
    different flavors of NG or biomass have different upstream emissions
