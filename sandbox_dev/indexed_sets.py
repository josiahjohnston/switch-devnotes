# Pyomo indexed sets are basically an associative array of sets. Each member of the array is a set that shares the same structure. The array indexes can be multi-dimensional and are specified at the beginning of the Set command. The indexes are completely independent of the dimensionality of the set. Indexed sets cannot be used to index other parameters or other sets. An individual set contained within an indexed set could be used for that in theory, but in practice this may prove difficult to do in the context of an abstract model. 
# Example:
# Set foo is indexed by a one-dimensional value 1-n and contains two dimensional elements: 
#   {1: {(a b), (c d), (e f)}, 2: {(z y), (a b), (x w)}
# foo[1] shares the same structure as foo[2] but is a completely distinct set. 

# This works, but doesn't yet capture the membership of timepoints within a dispatch scenario.
