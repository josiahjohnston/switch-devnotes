Generators

    costs? (default, and allow projects to override?)
    emissions rate is derived from heat rate & carbon intensity of fuel
Generator sub-types
    dispatchable, intermittent, dam-hydro, RoR-hydro, pumped-hydro, storage, CAES, ...

To do
--------------

Project capacity
    location
    build limits
    min_build_year?
    vintage stuff?
    project-specific financial calculations
    auto-generate vintages from tech's min_build_year, etc?
Project dispatch
    capacity factors
Transmission
energy balancing
    bus-level
    Storage balancing
        circular time series vs cut off ends
Reliability...
    planning_reserve_margin
    quickstart, spinning reserve margins
    satisfy load
    satisfy various reserve margins
Policies
    POLICY_REGIONS 
        ..geographical_region ? (could mean either state or province, but is less familiar and more vague. SubnationalDivision could work, but may not be as flexible for international interconnections. Jurisdiction and PolicyRegion are also options.)
    lz_policy_region[z] default None
    rps_technologies[z] = set(in Tech)
    RPS targets (overall & carve-outs)
    carbon caps
    tech build restrictions (could also implement with proposed project restrictions..)

Low priority
------------------
Enable more upstream emission types for fuels, including CH4
Allow generators to burn multiple fuels, possibly at different heat rates
    cofiring biomass with coal
    oil generators that can run on multiple fuel types
    different flavors of coal have different extra pollutants
    different flavors of NG or biomass have different upstream emissions
